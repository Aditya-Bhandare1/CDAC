ï‚· Error to Investigate: Why does this code not compile? What does the error tell you about the 
types allowed in switch expressions? How can you modify the code to make it work? 
Ans: A switch statement works with the following primitive types and their wrappers:

byte
short
char
int
In addition, you are allowed to switch on an enum or String (since Java 5). However, Boolean, long, float, and double types are prohibited.*/
