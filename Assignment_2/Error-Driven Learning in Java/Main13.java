/*null is a reserved keyword in Java that signifies the absence of any value. Moreover, assigning a null value to an object reference implies that it doesn’t refer to any object or value in the memory.

By default, Java initializes reference variables with null values and primitives with default values based on their type. As a result, we cannot assign null to primitives.

If we assign null to a String object, it’s initialized but not instantiated and hence holds no value or reference. */
