        double result = num / 4.0; 
        System.out.println(result); 
    } 
}

/* What is the result of this operation? Is the output what you expected? */
no as we are getting ans as 2.0 so we have updated int  num = 10; to  Double num = 10.0;
also updated double result = num / 4; to double result = num / 4.0;

Now ans is 2.5  */
